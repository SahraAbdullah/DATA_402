### <ins>Variables </ins>


<p> 
Variables are containers for storing data values.

How do you create a variable?

It's simple, when you assign a value to a variable, that's when a variable is created.

Example :memo:

x = 5   
y = "John"

print(x)  
print(y)

**The output would be:**
5   
John

When you assign a new value to a variable, it can be cghanged because the variable now holds a different value than before
For example   
x = Summer   
x = Winter
Print(x) 

**Output:** Winter

***DON'T FORGET PYTHON IS CASE SENSITIVE***  

**Example:** 
a = 10   
A = "Hello"  
This will not overwrite a because of case sensitivity


**Casting**   
If you want to define the type of data a variable holds, you can achieve this by casting.

**Example:** 
x = str(5) # x will be '3'   
y = int(3) # y will be 3   
z = float(3)  # z will be 3.0

you can get the data type by using the type() function.   
**Example**  
x = 11   
y = "Macbook"  
print(type(x))   
print(type(y))

**Output:**  
int   
str

String variables can be declared either by using single or double quotes:  
**Example** 
x = "Apple"  
x = 'Pear'   
'' and "" is ~~not~~ the same thing in string.
